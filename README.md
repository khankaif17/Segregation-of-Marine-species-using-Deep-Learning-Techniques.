# Segregation-of-Marine-species-using-Deep-Learning-Techniques.
 In view of this picture, the research employs CNN, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) to evaluate and classify marine life species. It aims at developing an automated approach that performs better than standard deep learning techniques and conventional methods in identifying diverse types of aquatic creatures from images.
